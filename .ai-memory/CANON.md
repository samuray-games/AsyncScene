# Canon

This file captures stable product canon relevant to memory handling.

## Canon principles

- Git-tracked repo content is authoritative for implementation state.
- Memory documents should be easy to read from GitHub without local file access.
- The live memory index must stay compact enough for new chats to load quickly.
- Historical detail belongs in the archive, not the current memory snapshot.
- The live Google Drive project memory must remain synchronized with accepted remote state and must identify any repository-memory integration that is still pending.
- Every current-state summary must include the exact next action required to advance the project.

## Protected facts

- Bridge artifacts 062/063 are immutable history.
- Memory migration must not touch runtime/game code.
- Accepted behavior, UI canon, and process contracts should be recorded once here rather than repeated in the live index.
- The legacy pre-split root memory must be preserved as an archive artifact with exact bytes, not reauthored from summary text.
- A pending implementation branch is evidence of current work, not an accepted main state.
- Direct task writes to `main` remain forbidden unless explicit current authority grants them.

## Reading priority

- Use current repository primary evidence first.
- Use active task or bridge STATE for exact in-flight phase and next action.
- Use `CURRENT.md` for the compact live summary.
- Use this file for stable canon.
- Use the live Google Drive document for mandatory cross-chat bootstrap.
- Use the archive only when the current state needs historical context.
